# Statistics_Program
Final Project for first year university programming with data course. Completed with @fisayoadabs

## DATE COMPLETED: 
December 2021

## Description
This project is a combination of many tecniques leanred in this Python class. The main function of the project is to read in the csv files containing data on every country registered as a UN Nation at that time, ask the user for two countries, and display 3 graphs containing comparison data for the population, population desnity, and number of endangered species of the two chosen countries. It also ouptuts some summary statistics for each country in the terminal.

The graphs were created using `Matplotlib`, the CSV file data was read using `Numpy` and the `Math` module was used for some calculations.

The program also uses object-oriented-programming to create a Country object for the two requested countries and thereby use the an object method to print the terminal statistics. 

## Running the Program
Enusre you have the three mentioned Python libraries mentioned above (`Matplotlib`, `Numpy`, and `Math`) then run the file on the terminal of your choice.
